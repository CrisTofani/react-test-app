# Frontend Code Test Sketch

## Main goal

You can find the description [here](https://github.com/CrisTofani/react-test-app/blob/master/CHALLENGE.md)

## Requirements

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (latest stable version should be Ok)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install) (latest stable version should be Ok)
- Execute `yarn` from the `root` directory

## How to run?

- Execute `yarn && yarn start` 

---

## Decisions

* [CRA](http://create-react-app.dev/) has been chosen to bootstrap the application, the eject command has been executed to give more flexibility and avoid using react-scripts.
* **Typescript** I decided to use typescript with react since it is the language I commonly use with react-native and react development and to strenght the type checking through data load and components. 
* Using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) to build the minimal routing through the app.
* **Documents main route** have `/documents` help to route between the two available ids for documents (saved as constants).
* **Document detail route** have `/documents/:document-id` in order to load the current document through API.
* I decided to use [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) even if I actually never used in a production environment just to test my self, and to apply what I always read about them.
* Since we're querying a GraphQl API I decided to use [Apollo GraphQl](https://www.apollographql.com/) to handle all the data requests. This would help in case we need to ask the same document several time or in different components avoiding prop drilling, thanks to the in-client memory.
* Handles the error and loading scenarios thanks to `Apollo GraphQl`
* Added [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) in order to help out with code smells and code clean up. I just integrated the rules that I usually use on other projects
* Extracted **common** components as `Header`, `LoadingSpinner` or `Main` container in order to reuse them through all of my components.
* Even if at the beginning I was thinking about to build a Route only for the artboard detail, I preferred to handle it as an in-page component sending via prop the collection of the entries, and the current index to navigate in order to display only
* I calculate the correct image to show using a callback as the ref of my img container in order to choose the best fit for my webpage. As a fallback, I use the first image url and let it resize to the container size.
* Created some helpers to for query building and type checking.
* Types have been autogenerated starting from the received schema using https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/
* Bind the `Left` and `Right` key press handler on the Artboard viewer to improve navigation between different artboards, the click is ok too of course.

## Improvements

* Test, Test, Test...they were on my plan, but didn't have enough time, my bad!
* Move to the pipeline the type generation in order to make it more flexible and be correctly linked to the real schema.
* Improve the error handling, using some more strict types for errors, to configure the `Apollo GraphQl` client.
* At the moment all of the static strings are in a document threating them as constants, could be useful to store them in a proper way in order to help the internationalisation.
* Check and improve the accessibility of the project (no aria attributes has been specified, just the images alt).
* Improve the style handling on the Artboard's image, images are resized, but I don't think they'll look as actually requested.
* Absolutely need to improve in the CSS development (Personal note `:)`)
